///
///   Awake (-100)  spawn units. Must beat TurnManager.Awake (0), which sweeps the scene
///                 with FindObjectsByType<Unit> to build its roster. Anything spawned
///                 after that sweep would never take a turn.
///
///   Start (-100)  set unit positions. Must beat Unit.Start (0) -> SnapToGrid(), which
///                 reads transform.position to work out which cell to claim. By Start,
///                 every Awake has run, so GridManager has finished aligning itself to the
///                 floor tilemap and CellToWorld gives the right answer.
///
/// We deliberately do NOT call Unit.PlaceAt ourselves: SnapToGrid would then see the cell
/// as occupied (by the very unit standing on it) and nudge the unit off it.
///
/// With no encounter launched — i.e. you pressed Play directly in the combat scene — this
/// leaves whatever units you hand-placed alone, so the scene still works standalone.
